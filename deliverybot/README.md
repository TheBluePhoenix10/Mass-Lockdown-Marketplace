## Usage

### 1. Clone repository

### 2. create.env

Create a .env file with your settings in the root directory.

Always start with a new unused seed!

MAX_PAYMENT_TIME is the time until created paymentes aren't checked anymore in minutes (4320 = 3 days to pay, transactions after that are ignored)

If you want to send payouts, without receiving iotas via payments first, send the iotas to the first address of the seed (index 0)

```bash
SEED='REPLACEWITHEIGHTYONETRYTESEED'
IOTANODE='https://nodes.thetangle.org:443'
